name: "Chore: Lint/Format Cleanup"
about: Track Ruff formatter + linter cleanup in phases to keep diffs reviewable
labels: ["chore", "tech-debt"]

## Summary
Adopt consistent formatting (Ruff formatter) and linting (Ruff) across the repo. Execute in small, lowâ€‘risk phases. Black is optional and may be kept for local preference, but CI and Make targets use Ruff.

## Context
- Config: see `pyproject.toml` for `[tool.ruff]` (and `[tool.black]` kept for optional local use).
- Make targets: `make fmt`/`make fmt-check` (Ruff format), `make lint`/`make lint-fix` (Ruff check).

## Plan (Phased)
- [x] Phase 0: Confirm config + Makefile targets (fmt/lint); update AGENTS.md/README if needed.
- [x] Phase 1: Format tests and utils (Ruff format) and apply safe fixes (`ruff check --fix`).
- [ ] Phase 2: Import order fixes (I001) across `src/` (no behavior changes).
- [ ] Phase 3: Long lines (E501): selectively wrap/split; allow limited `# noqa: E501` for URLs/strings; E501 remains ignored globally for now.
- [ ] Phase 4: Modern typing upgrades (UP006/UP035) across `src/` where safe.
- [ ] Phase 5: Remaining fixables (e.g., F401 unused imports, minor style) with `--fix` and small manual changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `make fmt-check` passes.
- `make lint` shows no errors for the targeted phase paths.
- Tests remain green (`pytest -q`) after each phase.

## Notes
- Avoid refactors while cleaning style. Keep diffs mechanical and scoped.
- If any rule causes noisy changes, propose narrowing scope or adding per-file ignores.
